## Rules About Cheatsheets

You will be allowed to pre-upload and use 2 double-sided cheat sheets for the Part 1 exams, and pre-upload and use 2 more double-sided cheat sheets for Part 2. Hence, you could choose to prepare up to 4 cheat sheets in total, choose 2 to use in Part 1, and use all of them in Part 2.

Each cheatsheet must be letter-sized (8.5 inches by 11 inches) or A4 and can be double-sided.

You will be asked to upload cheatsheets as pdf for the first 2 exams before and cheatsheets for the last 2 exams by a specified deadline.

During the exams you can access on your screen the cheatsheets that you have uploaded before the corresponding exams open.

## Useful Tips 

### Tips from Chocoholic:
- The capstone exams are not as long as the in class finals on ocw but the types of questions/concepts are very similar

### Tips from Firanxa
- It's language agnostic, so you can use Python, R, Excel, or whatever youâ€™re most comfortable with.
- But you do need to know how to do common statistical analyses like descriptive statistics, creating new variables, and linear regressions.
- There are no programming-specific questions, like "how do you do this using this library?"

### Tips from Firanxa on reddit
 - I was most surprised by how short each exam was. Keep in mind that these exams are written to be more or less equivalent to what an on-campus MIT student would sit for a final exam. In that sense, it was also easier than I was expecting.

- There are no proofs, just as there weren't in any of the courses' homework and exams. General conceptual knowledge is tested in indirect ways. For example, you may not be asked "Is this a consistent estimator?" but something like "Which of the following is a consequence of consistency?"

- I made my cheatsheets in LaTeX. You can see how I did it here. I'd say that making the cheatsheets helped me more than actually using them did. It was nice to have them on hand for sanity checks, but you also have access to all course materials for that. Another benefit from taking the time to make cheatsheets: You'll know exactly where to find every fact and detail in every lecture slide.

- I reviewed all lecture slides and lesson notes. I didn't rewatch videos unless it was for a topic I remember having difficulty with when I took the course. I redid all homework, exercises, and exams. Honestly, redoing all these problems is sufficient preparation for the kinds of problems you'll see in the capstones. But be sure that you truly understand how to solve them and what the answers mean; don't be tempted to just memorize the posted solution. This is where recitation problems and videos were especially helpful.
