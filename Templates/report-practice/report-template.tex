\subsection*{Problem 1.0}
\begin{question}
0. (0 points) 
Submit a report for practice. 
\end{question}

\begin{solution}
This report is written mainly for the purpose of practicing report submission. In the process, I wrote a \LaTeX template that anyone may download and use. 
\begin{itemize}
\item[--] Basic template:\\
\url{https://github.com/ptoche/MIT-Data-Analysis/tree/main/report-template}
\item[--] This document:\\
\url{https://github.com/ptoche/MIT-Data-Analysis/tree/main/report-template}
\end{itemize}
With the basic template you can reproduce the question/solution/citation layout below.

\begin{question}
1. (2 points) 
How would you run a randomized controlled double-blind experiment to determine the effectiveness of the vaccine? Write down procedures for the experimenter to follow. 
(Maximum 200 words)
\end{question}

\begin{solution}
Write your answer in a brief and clear language. In addition, you should add all materials that you have consulted to in the Reference section at the end of the report.  These materials could be a paper \cite{Wasserstein:2016}, a book \cite{Gustavii:2017}, or some internet materials \cite{Wiki:PCA}.
